### Description

- I've worked with a variety of technologies as a front-end developer, including HTML5, CSS, and Javascript.
- The responsive and interactive interface of the website was designed using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, and Material UI.
- I've also worked with Javascript frameworks like VueJS and Quasar to offer a dynamic user experience. REST APIs were used for the data manipulation.
