### Description

- Developed and deployed NLP models for sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and text classification using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Preprocessed text data using techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization, and applied feature engineering methods such as TF-IDF and word embeddings.
- Collaborated with data scientists and software engineers to integrate NLP models into production systems, and optimized model performance using techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and regularization.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends in text data, and developed visualizations using tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Used REST API to share model predictions for various usage. Also developed responsive frontend of few applications to display data from REST APIs.
