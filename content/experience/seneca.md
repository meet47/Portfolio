### Description

- Worked on supervised, semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to optimize underutilized dental infrastructure and provide affordable dental care solution helping in 15 North American dental clinics to utilize their infrastructure efficiently.
- Fine-tuned foundational large language models including GPT, Llama, Mistral, and Gemma on custom dental health dataset using techniques like LoRA and QLoRA.
- Built efficient RAG pipeline to develop custom chat agent for personalized patient queries in dental healthcare, resulting in a 35% increment in query resolution.
- Implemented MLOps/LLMOps practices using Azure ML Studio and AWS Bedrock including robust deployment pipelines, to ensure seamless integration of model end points into dental software resulted into significant reduction of manual work.
