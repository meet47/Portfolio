### Description

- Gather and consolidate data from multiple sources, ensuring accuracy and completeness. Performed data cleaning, transformation and normalization to improve quality of data.
- Created clear and concise reports, dashboards and visualizations using Tableau and BI to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders. Developed automated reporting system to streamline data analysis and reporting process.
- Worked on a computer vision project named â€œSurface Quality Detection" to develop a system for object detection and recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and LSTM.
- Collected and labeled a large dataset of images, and preprocessed the data using techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- Implemented and trained CNN models using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch, optimized model performance using techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning.
- Conducted experiments to compare the performance of different CNN architectures and hyperparameters, and evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Created data pipelines among various system using SAP BODS ETL Tool.
