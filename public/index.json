[{"content":"The Book in Three Sentences The Bhagavad Gita is a sacred Hindu scripture that provides profound teachings on duty, spirituality, and the path to self-realization. It presents a conversation between Prince Arjuna and Lord Krishna, where Krishna imparts wisdom on fulfilling one\u0026rsquo;s duty without attachment to the outcomes, practicing self-discipline, and realizing the eternal nature of the soul. The Gita offers guidance on leading a balanced and purposeful life, emphasizing the importance of righteousness, devotion, and self-realization in achieving inner peace and spiritual growth. The Bhagavad Gita Summary Setting the Stage: The story takes place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, just before the great Kurukshetra War. Arjuna, a skilled warrior, becomes overwhelmed with moral and emotional confusion as he faces the prospect of fighting against his own relatives and revered teachers.\nDharma and Duty: Lord Krishna imparts profound philosophical teachings to Arjuna, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling one\u0026rsquo;s duty or dharma. Krishna explains that every individual has a unique role to play in society and that one should perform their duties selflessly, without attachment to the outcome.\nPaths to Liberation: The Bhagavad Gita explores different paths to attain liberation or self-realization. It discusses three main paths: Karma Yoga (the path of selfless action), Bhakti Yoga (the path of devotion and love for the divine), and Jnana Yoga (the path of knowledge and self-inquiry). Krishna highlights that all paths ultimately lead to the same goal of attaining union with the divine.\nUnderstanding the Self: The Gita delves into the nature of the self and its relationship to the body, mind, and soul. Krishna explains the eternal and indestructible nature of the soul (Atman) and the transient nature of the physical body. He encourages Arjuna to identify with the soul rather than the temporary aspects of existence.\nControl of the Mind and Senses: Krishna emphasizes the importance of controlling the mind and senses, as they can be sources of distraction and delusion. He teaches techniques to discipline the mind, such as meditation and detachment from desires, to achieve spiritual progress.\nRenunciation and Detachment: The Bhagavad Gita explores the concept of renunciation and detachment, emphasizing that one can be actively engaged in the world while maintaining inner detachment. Krishna explains that true detachment is not avoiding responsibilities but rather performing actions without seeking personal gain or attachment.\nThe Supreme Reality: Krishna reveals his divine nature to Arjuna and explains that he is the ultimate reality, the source of all creation, and the essence that pervades everything. He invites Arjuna to surrender to him and find refuge in his divine presence.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/bhagavad-gita/","summary":"The Book in Three Sentences The Bhagavad Gita is a sacred Hindu scripture that provides profound teachings on duty, spirituality, and the path to self-realization.

Clear presents practical strategies and principles for building positive habits and breaking negative ones, focusing on four laws of behavior change: making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. By implementing these principles and understanding the importance of identity and environment, readers can make lasting improvements and achieve remarkable results in their personal and professional lives. The Atomic Habits Summary The power of atomic habits: Clear introduces the concept of atomic habits, which are small, consistent actions that compound over time to produce significant outcomes. By focusing on the process of habit formation rather than solely on goals, we can make continuous progress and achieve remarkable results.\nThe four laws of behavior change: Clear presents four laws that govern the process of habit formation:\na. Make it obvious: Increase the visibility of positive habits and reduce the visibility of negative ones. This can be done by creating visual cues, designing your environment to support desired behaviors, and using implementation intentions to plan your actions.\nb. Make it attractive: Associate positive habits with immediate rewards and make them appealing. One way to do this is to use habit stacking, where you pair a new habit with an existing one, creating a sense of momentum.\nc. Make it easy: Simplify the process of performing positive habits by reducing friction and lowering the activation energy required to start. Clear suggests breaking habits down into smaller steps and removing obstacles that hinder their execution.\nd. Make it satisfying: Reinforce positive habits by creating a sense of immediate satisfaction. This can be achieved through various strategies, such as tracking your progress, using habit contracts, and employing social accountability.\nThe importance of identity: Clear argues that to make lasting changes, it is essential to focus on your identity and beliefs. By adopting new beliefs and seeing yourself as the type of person who embodies the desired habits, it becomes easier to align your actions with your desired outcomes.\nThe role of habit tracking: Clear highlights the significance of habit tracking as a tool for self-awareness and improvement. By monitoring your habits, you gain insights into your behavior patterns, identify areas for improvement, and stay motivated by observing your progress.\nThe power of small improvements: Clear emphasizes the power of marginal gains, which refers to making small, incremental improvements over time. By focusing on getting 1% better each day and continuously refining your habits, you can achieve significant long-term progress.\nThe impact of environment: Clear emphasizes the influence of our environment on our habits. Modifying our surroundings to align with our desired behaviors can provide cues and make it easier to stick to positive habits.\nThe role of social influence: Clear discusses the impact of social norms and the people we surround ourselves with. Joining groups or communities that have similar goals and habits can provide support, encouragement, and accountability.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/atomic-habits/","summary":"The Book in Three Sentences \u0026ldquo;Atomic Habits\u0026rdquo; by James Clear is a book that emphasizes the power of small habits and their cumulative impact on our lives.

The neural network, a combination of CNN and LSTM, was trained on the MS COCO dataset and it learns to generate captions from images.\nAs the network generates the caption, word by word, the model’s gaze (attention) shifts across the image. This allows it to focus on those parts of the image which is more relevant for the next word to be generated. Furthermore, beam search is used during inference to enhance the prediction result. The network was trained in PyTorch on an Nvidia GTX 1060 graphics card for over 80 epochs.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/automated-image-captioning/","summary":"🔗 Colab Notebook Description In this project, I implemented the paper Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention.

Resnet-18 was used as the model with some slight modifications to the input and output layer. The model was trained on the official DLib Dataset containing 6666 images along with corresponding 68-point landmarks for each face. Additionally, I wrote a custom data preprocessing pipeline in PyTorch to increase variance in the input images to help the model generalize better. The neural network was trained for 30 epochs before it reached the optima.\nDuring inference, OpenCV Harr Cascades are used to detect faces in the input images. Detected faces are then cropped, resized to (224, 224), and fed to our trained neural network to predict landmarks in them. The predicted landmarks in the cropped faces are then overlayed on top of the original image.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/face-landmarks-detection/","summary":"🔗 Github Repository Description In this project, I trained a neural network to localize key points on faces.
